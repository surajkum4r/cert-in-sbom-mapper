# CERT-In SBOM Mapper
This project is created to help generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) compliant with the CERT-In technical guidelines. The guideline mandates the following elements included in the SBOM:

- Component Name  
- Component Version  
- Component Description  
- Hashes  
- Vulnerabilities  
- Criticality  
- Timestamp  
- Unique Identifier  
- Component Origin  
- Component Dependencies  
- Patch Status  
- Release Date  
- End-of-Life Date  
- Usage Restrictions  
- Comments or Notes  
- Component Supplier  
- Executable Property  
- Archive Property  
- Structured Property  
- External References  

For detailed guidelines, refer to the official CERT-In document:  
[Technical Guidelines on SBOM by CERT-In](https://www.cert-in.org.in/PDF/TechnicalGuidelines-on-SBOM)

## Why CERT-In SBOM Mapper?

While exploring multiple paid and open-source tools, none fully satisfy all the minimum elements required by the CERT-In guideline. This tool serves as an addon to existing SBOM generators by adding all missing fields and enables exporting the augmented SBOM in CycloneDX and Excel formats.

---

## Features

- Upload tool-generated CycloneDX SBOM files  
- Edit and complete missing mandatory fields as per CERT-In guidelines  
- Export the updated SBOM in CycloneDX JSON and Excel formats for compliance
- Background auto-population for CERT-In properties (Patch Status, Release Date, Criticality, etc.)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or newer recommended)  
- npm package manager
- Cyclonedx file v1.5

Optional but recommended:
- Create a `.env` file at project root (see below)

### Installation and Running

1. Clone this repository:  
`git clone https://github.com/surajkum4r/CERT-In-SBOM-Mapper`
2. Navigate into the project directory:  
`cd cert-in-sbom-mapper`
3. Install dependencies:  
`npm install`
4. Start the development server:  
`npm start`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Environment (.env)


```
# Enable fetch debug (alerts/logs) while testing
REACT_APP_DEBUG_FETCH=0

# Optional GitHub token; if not set, GitHub is skipped entirely
# REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx
```

Notes:
- GitHub is only used for enrichment (stars, forks, repo license) and as a fallback for Release Date; skipping it does not affect Patch Status/Criticality.
- Set `REACT_APP_DEBUG_FETCH=1` while testing to see background fetch alerts and logs.

---

## Usage

1. Upload your tool-generated CycloneDX SBOM file.  
2. The app auto-populates CERT-In properties in the background (batching to avoid rate limits).  
3. Review and optionally edit any fields.  
4. Export the SBOM as JSON, CSV or Excel.

### What gets auto-populated

- Patch Status: via OSV (fixed versions) and registry latest version.  
  - Examples: `Update available (>= 2.8.9)`, `Update available (latest 1.2.3)`, `Up to date`.
- Release Date: from package registries (npm/PyPI/Maven); GitHub created_at as fallback when token is set.  
- Criticality: highest of:  
  1) SBOM `vulnerabilities[].ratings[].severity` matched by `affects[].ref` → component `bom-ref`  
  2) OSV CVSS score mapping  
  3) Count-based fallback (if needed)
- End-of-Life Date: from `endoflife.date` for known products (nodejs, python, java). Library EOL is usually not published.

### Considerations and limitations

- OSV may not always return severity or fixed versions immediately for new advisories; in such cases Criticality may be Unknown and Patch Status may show `Update available (>= NA)`.
- endoflife.date publishes product/platform EOL, not library EOL. Many Maven libraries legitimately have no EOL.
- GitHub calls are skipped if no token is set, to avoid 401/429 rate limits.
- Background fetching is batched; large SBOMs can take time to complete.

## Future Updates

- Additional ecosystems and data sources (NuGet, Maven SCM parsing improvements)
- Support for additional SBOM formats
